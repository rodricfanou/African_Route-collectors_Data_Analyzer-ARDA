## ARDA

In this repository, you can find all the information related to the visualization part of the African Route collector Data Analyzer (ARDA).

The visualization scripts are divided into three sections:

* **IXP View:** statistics per IXP 
* **National View:** statistics per set of IXPs in the same country
* **Regional View:** statistics computed based on the data from all IXPs in the region

Requirements:
* Apache
* MySQL
* PHP

We strongly recommend you to follow a LAMP (Linux + Apache + MySQL + PHP) installation guide. Here you can find some examples:
